     Rummy sqaure <br>
     <p class="projectDescriptionFont">Rummikub is a tile-based game for 2 to 4 players,<br>
       combining elements of the card game rummy and mahjong.
        There are 106 tiles in the game,<br> including 104 numbered
         tiles (valued 1 to 13 in four different colors, two copies of each) 
         and two jokers. Players have 14 or 16 tiles initially<br> and take turns
          putting down tiles from their racks into sets (groups or runs) of<br> at
           least three, drawing a tile if they cannot play. In the Sabra version 
           (the most common and popular), the first player<br> to use all their 
           tiles scores a positive score based on the total of the other players'
            hands,<br> while the losers get negative scores. An important feature
             of the game is
       that players can work with<br> the tiles that have already been played. </p>
